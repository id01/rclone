Notes:
Structure of our metadata at the end is:
gzipExtraify(gzip([4-byte header size][4-byte block size] ... [4-byte block size][4-byte raw size of last block]))

LZ4 implementation:
Flags:
	Version = 01
	Independent = 1
	Block Checksum = 1
	Content Size = 0
	Content Checksum = 0
	Reserved = 0
	Dictionary ID = 0

BD byte:
	Reserved = 0
	Block Max Size = 101 (or 5; 256kb)
	Reserved = 0000

[Header Checksum byte]

[Blocks with xxhash checksums]

[4 null bytes]

[gzip stuff as trailing garbage]
